WandB:
- does not require any additional ports to be exposed for running in a Docker container. It is a tool for visualizing and tracking machine learning experiments, and its communication with the WandB servers is typically done through the HTTP and HTTPS protocols.
- Once you activate the myenv environment using the conda activate myenv command, you should be able to use WandB in your Python code without any issues.
